# Project-Game
Game development project

Ideas:
- Hades like rpg
- Focus on fun fighting and movement
    - Potential for lots of different weapons
    - Potential movement upgrades/upgrades in general
- Post apocalyptic
    - Pre-apocalyptic flash backs that are still fun to play
- Chill mode when there are no enemies around?
    - Switch into cool fighting mode when there are?
    - Maybe just like holding your weapon vs not holding it
- Map and HUD so that players don't get lost easily
- Enemies always respawn? Maybe souls like? Similar to hollow knight???
- Maybe like old zelda but more fun to do everything

Story:
- Aliens come to Earth because it was the only nearby planet with proper conditions for life
- Plan to communicate with us/be nice in the beginning, but humans were too nervous and started war
- Aliens essentially wipe us out
- Our reason for life is that all our family and loved ones were killed
- Got used to living in this newly inhabited world


- Nah lets go cool monsters
- Maybe a world where humans and monsters were always living together in "peace"
- In reality humans would treat monsters poorly but the monsters had some semblance of smarts
- Some monsters (okay I am kinda going planet of the apes revolution for monsters kinda deal)
were smarter than the others and wanted to retaliate against the humans (uses some fungi to make them go all insane)
- In the beginning you had someone who supported the monsters and was so kind to them, you looked up to her
- Eventually she gets killed by them and most people are killed by the monsters
- You try to kill them all, but also are trying to figure out a cure for the monsters so that they don't need to be living in pain
- You are able to save some and they help you out
- Eventually the goal is to kill the main evil big dude who has been cursing the monsters and making them crazy
- Flashbacks to times before with the girl or anyone else who was close to you gives you powerups and makes you strong
- Flashback in the boss fight resets your health to full and gives you bonus stats as you fight with the girl
- Eventually you are able to save the monsters from this pain and they are happy/neutral about life again
- You work with a vet/doctor girl throughout the game who is researching how to save the monsters
- Also humans can get infected but they just get sick and die, they don't turn into zombies
